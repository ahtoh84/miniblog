#### 序幕

**October 15, 1991**
**1991 年 10 月 15 日**

**U.S. Embassy, Tallinn, Estonia**
**美国驻爱沙尼亚塔林大使馆**

“Very snazzy, Mr. Fuller.”
“真有型，富勒先生。”

“Very retro,” replied the deputy chief of mission. “Not my tie,” he added, giving both ends of the black bow a last adjustment. “Your ‘snazzy.’” He turned around to face Ms. Boyle. “It’s a long time since I’ve heard that one.”
“很有怀旧风，”副使团团长笑着回应。“我指的不是我的领带，”他补充道，一边最后调整了一下黑色蝴蝶结的两端。“是你说的‘有型’。”他转过身面对博伊尔女士。“我好久没听到这个词了。”

“I suppose I could say you look ‘baaad.’”
“要不我说你看起来‘帅呆了’？”

Ms. Boyle, Hawkins Fuller imagined, was just on the sunny side of forty, old enough to know “snazzy” and young enough to know “baaad,” though for that matter, even he, at sixty-six, knew that “baaad” meant “good.”
霍金斯·富勒心想，博伊尔女士大概刚过四十，风华正茂，年纪大到熟悉“有型”这个词，又年轻到能用“帅呆了”这种说法。不过话说回来，即便是他，六十六岁了，也知道“帅呆了”其实是夸人的意思。

She lingered a moment, the way women still did in the presence of Hawkins Fuller, imagining when the full head of silvery hair had been black, the way the eyebrows still were, in Gregory Peck–style contrast. But Mr. Fuller was better-looking than Gregory Peck.
她稍作停留，就像许多女人在霍金斯·富勒面前常做的那样，脑海中想象着他如今满头银发曾经乌黑的样子，而他的眉毛依然浓密，与格利高里·派克式的鲜明对比相得益彰。不过，富勒先生比格利高里·派克还要帅气。

He, too, lingered for a moment, prolonging the familiar comfort of admiration. “These,” he finally said, pointing to the stack of badly printed telexes near the edge of his desk: “Very bad. Not ‘baaad.’ Just lousy.”
他也稍稍停顿，享受着这份熟悉的被欣赏的舒适感。“这些，”他终于开口，指着桌边一叠印刷质量极差的电传文件：“真是差劲。不是‘帅呆了’那种差，就是纯粹的烂。”

“I know,” sighed Ms. Boyle, who doubted that the embassy, still being flung together, would be getting even internal e-mail anytime soon. “But that guy’s been working miracles with the phones. They’re twenty times better than last week. The ambassador talked to Brussels and Washington twice today. Clear as a bell both times. And here,” she said, darting back out to her desk and returning with some regular mail from the pouch. “A primitive but reliable means of communication.” She could see that the envelopes were personal, so she set them down unopened and left with a friendly marching order: “Don’t dawdle. Lucy will be downstairs in five minutes.”
“我明白，”博伊尔女士叹了口气，她怀疑这座还在草草搭建中的大使馆短期内连内部电子邮件都用不上。“不过那个负责电话的人简直创造了奇迹。现在比上周好太多了，大使今天和布鲁塞尔、华盛顿各通了两次电话，声音都清澈得像铃声一样。还有这个，”她说着，迅速回到自己桌前，从邮袋里取回一些普通信件。“一种老派但靠谱的沟通方式。”她看出这些信封是私人的，便没有拆开，直接放在桌上，临走前友好地叮嘱道：“别磨蹭，露西五分钟后就到楼下了。”

He wondered how many years ago Ms. Boyle would still have been saying “Mrs. Fuller” instead of “Lucy.”
他暗自琢磨，若是放在几年前，博伊尔女士大概还会正式地称呼“富勒夫人”，而不是如今亲切地叫“露西”。

“All right,” he replied. “And if I do dawdle”—he always did; the shambling and the daydreaming made his good looks even more appealing —“just buzz me, Miss Blue.”
“好的，”他回答道。“如果我真磨蹭了”——他总是如此，慢悠悠的步伐和心不在焉的神态反而让他英俊的外貌更具魅力——“就提醒我一声，蓝小姐。”

Ms. Boyle looked puzzled.
博伊尔女士一脸困惑。

“Ah,” said Fuller. “That one you are too young for.”
“哦，”富勒笑着说，“这个称呼你还太年轻，体会不到。”

She left, smiling as she closed the door, leaving Fuller to pick up the two bright-orange envelopes atop the pile of mail she’d just placed on his desk: Halloween cards, a little early, from the grandchildren in Potomac. Farther down the stack, a letter from Lucy’s Realtor in D.C., about that house in Chevy Chase she was determined to buy.
她微笑着关上门离开了，留下富勒拿起她刚放在桌上的那堆邮件中最上面的两个亮橙色信封：来自波托马克的孙子孙女寄来的万圣节贺卡，时间稍早了些。信堆下面还有一封露西在华盛顿的房产经纪人寄来的信，内容是关于她铁了心要买的那栋切维蔡斯的房子。

They’d be home for good in another year, and he’d finally take up the halftime job being held for him at the Carnegie Endowment. Odd to find himself here, in the meantime, helping out with the New World Order. He was supposed to have wound up his career last spring, after the six years in Bulgaria. It had never been that much of a career, and he’d never much minded that, but as he looked out on the darkening Gulf of Finland, he seemed compelled to make a fast review of it, as if it were one of the checking-for-Alzheimer’s exercises that Lucy wanted to add to their breakfast regimen of bran muffins and Centrum Silver tablets.
再过一年，他们将彻底回国，他也会接下卡内基基金会为他保留的半职工作。在此期间，竟发现自己身处此地，参与构建所谓的新世界秩序，着实有些奇怪。他本该在去年春天结束在保加利亚的六年任期后，就此告别职业生涯。那算不上什么辉煌的事业，他也从不介意，但当他凝视逐渐暗下来的芬兰湾时，却忍不住快速回顾起过往，仿佛这是露西打算加入他们早餐麦麸松饼和善存银片之外的另一项预防阿尔茨海默症的小测试。

All right: the six years in Bulgaria; the four before that in D.C.; the four years prior to those at the U.S. mission to the UN. Which put you back in the mid- and late seventies—some luck for that to be the era when they finally got posted to New York! And yet, for all the fiscal calamity and crime (that awful broad-daylight hour when Lucy came home with a bruised cheek and no purse), he’d ridden the handbasket through some interesting stops on its way to hell. At fifty, he’d been too old, really, for the underground pleasures that were suddenly so unpoliced. But his looks had granted him an extension, allowed him occasional, plausible entry to the throbbing middle-of-the-night world west of West Street. It had been some luck, a portion of his lifetime’s worth, to have made it home from those forays without so much as a hangover, let alone the time-released fate that would now be necessitating one of those humiliating obits with their mention of a “long illness” or “pneumonia” that even Lucy, behind her newspaper and bran muffin, could manage to decode.
好吧，先是在保加利亚待了六年；之前在华盛顿特区四年；再往前是美国驻 UN 代表团的四年。这么算来，就回到了七十年代中后期——能在那时被派往纽约，真是走运！尽管当时财政危机和犯罪猖獗（露西有一次大白天回家，脸颊青肿，钱包也不见了，那一刻真是糟透了），他还是在跌宕起伏中经历了一些有趣的片段。五十岁时，他其实已经不太适合参与那些突然无人监管的地下娱乐活动了。但他的外貌为他争取了额外的时间，偶尔还能合理地融入西街以西那午夜时分充满活力的世界。能从那些冒险中平安归来，连宿醉都没有，更别提那种逐渐显现、令人不堪的命运——如今可能会导致一篇讣告，提到“长期患病”或“肺炎”，就连露西，躲在报纸和麦麸松饼后面，也能轻易读懂其中隐意——这真是他人生中的一大幸事。

But I digress, he thought, resuming the fast, reassuring rewind. He reached the six years in Austria (Nixon mostly); then the four in Sweden, where the draft dodgers had more social status than the embassy people, who ran down LBJ as much as they decently could while shaking their heads and nibbling the host’s gravlax. And before that? The fourteen years, 1952 to ’66, right in Foggy Bottom in the State Department’s Bureau of Congressional Relations, where he would have been happy to stay forever, until Lucy decided that he should use his small accumulations of clout and connectedness to effect a shift, at the age of forty, from the civil to the foreign service. It was time for them to see the world, she had decreed.
不过我跑题了，他心想，继续快速而安心地回忆。他想起了在奥地利的六年（多半是尼克松时期）；然后是瑞典的四年，那里逃兵役的人比大使馆人员更有社会地位，后者一边摇头，一边啃着主人家的腌鲑鱼，尽可能体面地批评林登·约翰逊。再往前呢？从 1952 年到 1966 年的十四年，他在雾谷的国务院国会关系局工作，本可以心满意足地待一辈子，直到露西决定，他该利用自己积累的那点影响力和人脉，在四十岁时从文职转向外交服务。她宣布，是时候让他们去见识世界了。

And that was it, a life span so well recollected, he decided, there was no need to do the date ranges for the early sojourns in Oslo and Paraguay, let alone Harvard and the navy and St. Paul’s. Nope, no Alzheimer’s for Mrs. Fuller’s little boy. Tomorrow morning he’d tell Lucy to skip the muffins and to scramble some eggs in an aluminum skillet.
就这样，他心想，人生轨迹记得如此清楚，没必要再细数早年在奥斯陆和巴拉圭的日子，更不用提哈佛、海军和圣保罗学校的时光了。不，富勒太太的小伙子可没得老年痴呆。明早他要告诉露西，别吃松饼了，用铝锅炒点鸡蛋吧。

He wondered: When they got home, would there be bus service from Maryland down to the Carnegie on Massachusetts Avenue? During his last period at State—’81 to ’85, Reagan I, thank you very much—he had never gotten the hang of the new Metro, whose underground rumblings had, in any case, never been permitted to disturb Georgetown. He was wishing that Lucy would just let them go back there, and forget about this pile in Chevy Chase, when he noticed the small white envelope addressed in a feminine hand with the neatness of his wife’s generation.
他不禁好奇：回到家后，从马里兰州到马萨诸塞大道的卡内基基金会还有公交车吗？在他最后一次在国务院工作期间——1981 到 1985 年，里根第一任期，谢谢——他始终没搞懂新地铁怎么用，反正地铁的地下轰鸣声也从不允许打扰乔治城。他正希望露西能同意他们回那里住，忘了切维蔡斯那堆房产的事，这时，他注意到一个白色小信封，字迹娟秀，像是他妻子那一代人特有的工整。

One of her Wellesley pals? Maybe, though he couldn’t recall any Russell in Scottsdale, Arizona. Only after another few seconds did he see that the letter was for himself and not his wife. So he slit it open—and soon heard himself saying Christ Almighty.
是她在韦尔斯利的某个老友吗？或许吧，不过他想不起亚利桑那州斯科茨代尔有哪个姓拉塞尔的人。几秒后，他才发现信是写给自己的，不是给妻子。于是他拆开信封——很快，他不禁低声惊呼：“天哪！”

Dear Fuller, Tim Laughlin died September 1 in a Catholic hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. He was 59 and had been sick for some time. I heard from him often—almost never saw him, but counted him a good friend.
亲爱的富勒，蒂姆·劳克林于 9 月 1 日在罗德岛普罗维登斯的一家天主教医院去世，享年 59 岁。他病了有一段时间。我常收到他的消息——几乎没见过面，但我视他为好友。

I don’t know whether you pray (I myself don’t), but if you do, I know that, even now, he would appreciate your prayers.
我不知道你是否会祈祷（我自己并不），但如果你会，我相信，即使是现在，他也会感激你的祷告。

Whatever the case, I thought you should know.
不管怎样，我觉得你该知道这件事。

Yours sincerely, Mary (Johnson) Russell
此致，玛丽（约翰逊）·拉塞尔

It had been more than thirty years since he’d talked to either one of them, and it was easier, now, to think of her first.
自从他与他们中的任何一个交谈以来，已过去三十多年，现在，先想起她似乎更容易些。

She had never called him Hawkins. She’d thought it a preposterous first name and told him so, said “the last shall be first” and that he would be “Fuller” with her, under any and all circumstances. He’d replied that she didn’t know the half, that “Hawkins” was really his middle name, “Zechariah” being the first. And they’d laughed, she with the sharp glint in her eye that sometimes made him call her La Pasionaria, not because the glint was passionate but because it declared, so plainly, that you, Z. Hawkins Fuller, shall not pass. It wasn’t the castle of sex from which Mary Johnson had barred him during their long non-affair; that had never really been at issue. It was any sort of confidence she had barred him from. It was her trust.
她从不叫他霍金斯。她觉得这个名字荒唐得不行，直言不讳地告诉他，说“末者为先”，在她这里，无论何时何地，他都只能是“富勒”。他则笑着说，她只知其一，“霍金斯”其实是他的中间名，真正的名字是“撒迦利亚”。两人相视而笑，她的眼中闪着锐利的光芒，有时让他戏称她为“拉帕西奥纳里亚”，并非因为那光芒充满激情，而是因为它清楚地宣示：你，Z·霍金斯·富勒，休想越界。在他们漫长的非恋情中，玛丽·约翰逊拒绝他的并非肉体上的亲密——那从来不是重点——而是任何形式的内心敞开，是她的信任。

He put her letter back in its envelope, and the envelope into a drawer, a different drawer from the one into which he’d put the grandchildren’s cards and the Realtor’s letter.
他将信重新装回信封，然后放进一个抽屉，与存放孙辈贺卡和房产经纪人信件的抽屉分开。

Poor, sad, merry little Tim, he thought, looking at the clock. AIDS, of course.
可怜又快乐的小蒂姆，他盯着时钟心想。自然是艾滋病。

He stood up and walked into the outer office.
他站起身，走进外间办公室。

“You beat my summons by ten seconds,” said Ms. Boyle. “She’s downstairs.”
“你比我叫你早了十秒，”博伊尔女士说，“她在楼下等着呢。”

And so she was. Almost as slim as she’d been at Wellesley; her hair, now a silvery gold, in the same thick little pageboy she’d always worn; her outfit the one she’d explained to him at breakfast. A robin’s-egg-blue jacket over a white blouse above a black skirt: add it up and you had the Estonians’ new, which was to say old, tricolor flag. No one would expect the number-two man’s wife to go to this sort of trouble, and no one would fail to notice how much prettier she was than the number-one man’s wife.
她果然在。身材几乎和在韦尔斯利时一样苗条；头发如今是银金色，仍是她一贯的浓密童花头；穿着早餐时向他描述的那套衣服：知更鸟蛋蓝外套，内搭白衬衫，下身是黑裙，组合起来恰似爱沙尼亚新的——或者说旧的——三色旗。没人会想到第二号人物的妻子会如此用心打扮，也没人会忽略她比第一号人物的妻子漂亮得多的事实。

“So,” said Lucy, smiling brightly as she brushed down a couple of unruly stalks in her husband’s eyebrow, “Ms. Boyle tells me the mails are coming through.”
“怎么样，”露西笑容满面地说着，顺手理了理丈夫眉毛上几根不听话的毛发，“博伊尔小姐说邮件已经送到了。”

“Yes,” said her husband. “Neither rain, nor sleet, nor geopolitical convulsion…”
“是的，”她的丈夫答道。“不论风雨，不论冰雪，也不论地缘政治的动荡……”

Lucy continued to smile, brushing Hawkins’ lapels and enjoying the way two or three of the Estonian wives here in the reception hall were noticing her spousal attentions. Perhaps they were deciding she and Hawkins looked like that older couple in the Ralph Lauren ads. Hadn’t a Polo shop opened up in Tallinn? Almost everything else already seemed to have arrived.
露西继续微笑着，轻轻拍打霍金斯的衣领，享受着接待大厅里几位爱沙尼亚妻子注意到她对丈夫关怀备至的目光。或许她们在想，她和霍金斯就像拉夫·劳伦广告里的那对老年夫妇。塔林不是已经开了一家 Polo 店吗？几乎其他所有东西似乎都已到来了。

“Your Realtor wants us to go a little higher,” said Fuller.
“你的房产经纪人希望我们再加点价，”富勒说。

“Our Realtor, dearest.” She performed one last primp, pulling down Hawkins’ right cuff. He, too, knew that she was showing off their extended youth and vigor, as if freedom were a good brand of moisturizer they had wisely chosen long ago. This is what you’ve been missing for fifty years, she seemed to be saying to the Estonians, less from patriotism than personal pride.
“是我们的房产经纪人，亲爱的。”她最后整理了一下，拉直霍金斯的右袖口。他也清楚，她在炫耀他们依旧年轻的活力，仿佛自由是他们多年前明智选用的优质保湿霜。你们这五十年错过的就是这个，她似乎在对爱沙尼亚人说，与其说是爱国，不如说是出于个人自豪。

Fifty years? thought Fuller. More like all but twenty of the last five hundred. Who hadn’t rolled over this place? First the Swedes; later the Germans; only after that the Russians.
五十年？富勒心想。更像是过去五百年里，除了最近二十年，谁没在这片土地上折腾过？先是瑞典人，接着是德国人，最后才是俄国人。

Having at last let go of her husband, Lucy now clasped both hands of the foreign minister’s wife, exclaiming over her like a sorority sister who’d finally made it back for a reunion. Fuller took a glass of champagne from one of the waiters and moved away from the center of the room.
终于放开丈夫的手，露西热情地握住外交部长夫人的双手，像大学姐妹会的老友重逢般对她赞不绝口。富勒则从侍者手中接过一杯香槟，离开房间中央。

Though guests were still arriving, the American ambassador had already begun his toast to the embassy’s reopening, and all at once Fuller thought he could recall a party he’d gone to maybe thirty-five years ago, at the Estonians’ “embassy” in Washington, a sad little outpost shared by one of the other two captive Baltic nations. A handful of unlucky young fellows from State had been sent into a room full of smoked fish and stained suits to keep company with the exiles, to smile at them as if they were a girl with polio that everyone pretended would one day, somehow, get up out of that chair and walk again. Was it possible he’d brought Mary Johnson that night? Then taken her home in a cab and kissed her, on the cheek, before ten p.m.?
尽管宾客还在陆续到达，美国大使已开始为大使馆重新开放致祝酒词。突然间，富勒想起大约三十五年前参加过的一场聚会，那是在华盛顿的爱沙尼亚“大使馆”，一个与其他两个被占领的波罗的海国家共享的凄凉小据点。国务院派了几名倒霉的年轻人，去一间满是熏鱼和脏西装的房间里陪流亡者，微笑着面对他们，就像面对一个患小儿麻痹症的女孩，大家都假装她总有一天能从轮椅上站起来。那晚他是否带了玛丽·约翰逊一起去？然后坐出租车送她回家，在晚上十点前，轻轻吻了她的脸颊？

The ambassador was speaking of the long, unbroken “legal continuity” of U.S.-Estonian relations, as if the crippled girl had in some manner gone on dancing all along. But now they could all welcome her “peaceful return to the family of nations that are free in fact.” Applause, while Fuller mused upon how this return had very nearly not been peaceful at all. The Lithuanians, the first to flex their muscles after the wall came down, had driven Gorby into a real Stalinist snit, and Tallinn was lucky to have escaped the nasty thrashing, however futile, he’d dished out to Vilnius.
大使在谈论美爱关系长期、不间断的“法律连续性”，仿佛那个行动不便的女孩一直以某种方式跳着舞。但现在，他们都能欢迎她“和平回归到真正自由的民族大家庭”。掌声响起，而富勒却在思索，这次回归差点儿就谈不上和平。柏林墙倒塌后，立陶宛人率先展示力量，惹得戈尔巴乔夫大发斯大林式的脾气，塔林侥幸逃过了他施加给维尔纽斯的猛烈打击，尽管那打击终归徒劳。

Now the ambassador tried a bit of wordplay, sparsely appreciated, about the speed with which Estonia had gone from being a “captive” nation to a “most-favored” one. He went on to recount the astonishing events of the past two months: the failed coup in Moscow; the U.S.S.R.’s panicked recognition of the Baltic nations’ independence; the UN’s offer of seats to the three of them. The ambassador continued on, even as a murmur of bored chatter began to rise on the periphery of his audience. Fuller felt a tug at his elbow, from a young man eager to introduce him to a “formerly persecuted intellectual” who was now helping to draft the constitution. And once the ambassador officially subsided, this same avid introducer told Fuller it was “a great imperative” that he should meet the grizzled old man now being pulled toward him.
大使试着玩了点文字游戏，谈及爱沙尼亚如何迅速从“被俘”国家变为“最受青睐”的国家，但听众反应冷淡。他接着回顾了过去两个月令人震惊的事件：莫斯科政变失败；苏联仓皇承认波罗的海国家独立；UN 向这三国提供了席位。尽管听众边缘开始传来无聊的低语，大使仍在继续。富勒感到有人轻拉他的手臂，是个年轻人急于介绍他认识一位“曾受迫害的知识分子”，此人如今在协助起草宪法。大使正式结束讲话后，这位热情的引荐者又告诉富勒，他“务必”见见正被拉到他面前的满头白发的老者。

“Yes, of course,” said Fuller, smiling and shaking the old man’s hand. He understood that here was one of the “forest brotherhood” who after the war had refused to come in from the cold and accept the Soviets’ dominion, preferring instead to remain hidden in the woods. Not guerrillas, exactly; more, Fuller thought, like those Japanese soldiers who would turn up on a Pacific island, decades after the war, still hanging on to the fresh shirt they were convinced they’d wear on the day the emperor took the Americans’ surrender. Of course, these forest brothers had known the war was over, and still they’d stayed out there eating bark and twigs—a mystery to Fuller, who was pleased when the old man, looking hungry even now, relaxed his grip.
“当然可以，”富勒微笑着与老人握手。他知道，这位是“森林兄弟会”的一员，战后拒绝走出寒冷的森林接受苏联统治，宁愿藏身林间。他们不完全是游击队员，富勒觉得，他们更像是那些战后几十年还在太平洋岛屿上出现的日本士兵，依然攥着新衬衫，坚信天皇终将接受美国投降的那天会到来。当然，这些森林兄弟知道战争已结束，却仍留在野外，以树皮和枝条为生——这对富勒来说是个谜。当这位老人——即便现在看起来仍像饿着肚子——松开紧握的手时，富勒松了口气。

The guest list sent over by the Estonians had been overwhelmingly indigenous, whereas State, good sports as always, had made sure to add a dozen or so of the old occupying Russians, like the one Fuller was being introduced to now, a florid, white-haired man who’d spent the last thirty years running a phosphate mine—and five hundred people’s lives—in the northeastern part of the country. Fuller heard “phosphate” and made a joke about the fizz in his second glass of champagne; the Russian smiled uncomprehendingly, until a young man from the Foreign Ministry who’d just joined them translated the English remark—into Russian. Fuller realized that after three decades here, this amiable backpedaler, who had raised his glass higher than anyone else to the ambassador’s toast, knew fewer words of Estonian than Lucy had made it her business to acquire on the plane to Tallinn.
爱沙尼亚方面提供的宾客名单几乎全是本地人，而国务院一如既往地大度，特意加了十几位昔日的俄罗斯占领者，就像富勒现在被介绍认识的这位——一个面色红润、白发苍苍的男子，过去三十年在该国东北部经营一座磷酸盐矿，掌控着五百人的生计。富勒听到“磷酸盐”，便拿他第二杯香槟里的气泡开了个玩笑；那名俄罗斯人茫然地笑了笑，直到外交部的一位年轻人加入他们，将英文玩笑翻译成俄语。富勒意识到，这位和善的老人在此地生活了三十年，敬酒时举杯比谁都高，却连爱沙尼亚语都不会几句，甚至比露西在飞往塔林的飞机上临时学的还少。

“Mr. Deputy Chief,” said the young Foreign Ministry man, “my pleasure it is to present Mr. Lennart Meri.” Fuller had been briefed on this polymath: a writer, a film director, and now the foreign minister himself. Meri was, Fuller now assured him, handsome enough to be in front of the camera as well as behind.
“副团长先生，”年轻的外交部人员说，“我很荣幸向您介绍伦纳特·梅里先生。”富勒事先已了解这位多才多艺的人物：作家、电影导演，如今更是外交部长本人。富勒笑着对他说，梅里先生英俊得足以站在镜头前，而不仅仅是幕后。

“And look who is talking!” replied the minister. In another minute the two of them were arranging to have lunch—“anything but you Americans with your breakfasts!”—at the Stikliai Hotel.
“瞧瞧这是谁在说话！”部长笑着回应。没过一会儿，两人便约好在斯蒂克利艾酒店共进午餐——“除了你们美国人的早餐，什么都行！”

A man who’d been with the more conservative wing of the Popular Front interrupted them. An advocate, until recently, of “autonomy” rather than full-blown independence, he was in as much of a rush as the Russian phosphate boss to ingratiate himself with the new reality. Fuller, displaying the same wide, whitened smile he did for everyone else, welcomed the gentleman into the circle that was forming around him.
一位来自人民阵线保守派的人打断了他们。此人直到最近还主张“自治”而非完全独立，此刻却和那位俄罗斯磷酸盐矿老板一样，急于迎合新的现实。富勒露出他一贯对所有人展现的灿烂笑容，欢迎这位先生加入围绕他的小圈子。

“You see, Mr. Vice Ambassador,” said the Popular Front man, more for the foreign minister’s ears than Fuller’s, “it was what you would call a ‘neat trick’ for us to declare independence once the Soviet parliament finally pronounced the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the 1940 annexation to have been illegal all along.”
“您看，副大使先生，”人民阵线的人说道，这话更多是说给外交部长听，而非富勒，“一旦苏联议会最终宣布《莫洛托夫-里宾特洛甫条约》和 1940 年的吞并自始至终都是非法的，我们宣布独立就成了您所谓的一招‘妙棋’。”

“Explain that to me,” said Fuller, in the same bright tone Lucy was using to ask the phosphate boss’s wife how she managed to keep up with her grandchildren in Moscow.
“解释一下，”富勒用轻快的语气说，就像露西正用同样轻松的口吻询问磷酸盐矿老板的妻子，她如何在莫斯科照看孙辈。

“It was easier for them to admit that we had never been part of the U.S.S.R. than to let us secede,” said the man from the Popular Front, making sure his explanation registered with the foreign minister. “That,” he elaborated, “would have created a bad precedent. One that many other of the Soviet republics might still be wanting to use.”
“对他们来说，承认我们从不属于苏联，比允许我们脱离要容易得多，”人民阵线的人解释道，确保外交部长听明白了。“否则，”他进一步说，“会开一个坏先例，许多其他苏联加盟共和国可能也会想照做。”

“Nothing succeeds like secession,” said Fuller.
“没有什么比分裂更能成功了，”富勒调侃道。

The foreign minister smiled, but the Popular Front man, not getting the jest, began to fret that he had scored no points after all. Fuller gave him a friendly tap on the arm and thought: The Jesuits. That’s what Tim would be saying, with his strong, high laugh about the logic that had just been offered. The Jesuits would love that, Hawk!
外交部长会心一笑，但人民阵线的人没听出玩笑，担心自己白费口舌。富勒友好地拍了拍他的手臂，心中暗想：耶稣会士。蒂姆一定会这么说，用他那响亮高亢的笑声评论刚才的逻辑。耶稣会士会喜欢这套说辞的，霍克！

To Fuller’s relief, the musical program was about to begin, peppy alternations of Cole Porter and Baltic folk songs that Ms. Boyle had helped to pull together. She was at it even now, setting out the enameled-eagle party favors they’d been unable to find all afternoon.
富勒松了口气，音乐节目即将开始，是科尔·波特与波罗的海民谣的欢快交替，由博伊尔女士帮忙安排。此刻她还在忙着摆放他们整个下午都没找到的彩绘鹰形派对小礼品。

After twenty minutes and a fast vodka tonic, and while the Russian phosphate boss applauded the conclusion of “Friendship”—just a perfect blendship!—Fuller left the room. He knew that Lucy would cover for him.
二十分钟后，喝下一杯速成的伏特加汤力，当那位俄罗斯磷酸盐矿老板为《友谊》——多么完美的融合！——的结束鼓掌时，富勒悄然离场。他知道露西会替他掩护。

In half a minute he was out on the cobblestones, stepping off into the night, happy with the autonomy—if not exactly independence—that he’d always taken as his right. Lucy might make him drive her to see the sights in Narva next week, and come June she’d have a houseful of dull friends over from the States to see the White Nights; but however late he came home tonight, it would be all right. She lived, he knew, in a perpetual White Night of her own, pushing the clock back to whatever hour she decided he had come in at after all.
半分钟后，他踏上鹅卵石路，融入夜色，心中因这份自主——虽非完全独立——而感到满足，这份权利他一直视为理所当然。露西下周可能要他开车带她去纳尔瓦看风景，到了六月，她还会请一屋子从美国来的无聊朋友来欣赏白夜；但今晚不管他多晚回家，都不会有事。他知道，她活在自己的永恒白夜中，会把时钟拨回到她认定他归家的任何时刻。

It was really too cold to be out, and Fuller was still wary of walking here at all. Hard to imagine there were no longer Soviet troops on patrol. Actually, there were still some, not due to leave for a year or two more, by which time the Estonians would also have gotten rid of the rubles they were using even now. Awfully good-looking, some of those Russian boys he’d seen. Sweet faces, trying to look so hard under their stiff caps. Alas, how quickly those faces aged and sagged, the way it was with every good-looking Jewish boy he’d ever had back home.
外面实在太冷，富勒对在这儿走路仍心有余悸。很难想象苏联军队已不再巡逻。其实还有一些没走，要再过一两年才会撤离，到那时，爱沙尼亚人估计也会彻底放弃现在还在用的卢布。他见过的那些俄罗斯小伙子，有些长得真俊，甜美的脸庞，在硬邦邦的军帽下努力装出冷酷的样子。可惜，这些脸蛋老得太快，就像他家乡那些英俊的犹太男孩一样，转眼就没了青春。

Fuller looked up toward a small, pearl-onioned dome, not far from a stone staircase connecting the city’s old and upper towns. A strong wind was blowing across the gulf, maybe all the way from Finland, that country so like himself, for so long half free and quite comfortable, somehow exempt from the fuss of near-apocalypse. A young man was passing in the opposite direction. A student, Fuller supposed: slightly built, hands in big overcoat pockets, puffing a cigarette. Suggestive of another era; one imagined a book of censored poems inside the overcoat. Fuller looked back over his shoulder and, sure enough, found the young man doing the same. But Fuller’s smile unnerved the boy, who soon continued on, eyes front, toward his destination.
富勒抬头望向一座小巧的洋葱头圆顶建筑，离连接城市老区和上区的石阶不远。一阵强风从海湾吹来，或许是从芬兰一路刮来的，那个国家和他颇有几分相似，长期以来半自由却过得挺舒服，莫名其妙地避开了近乎末日的喧嚣。一个年轻人从对面走过。富勒猜他是个学生：身形瘦削，双手插在大衣口袋里，嘴里叼着烟，像是另一个时代的影子，仿佛大衣里藏着一本被禁的诗集。富勒回头一看，果然发现那年轻人也在回头张望。但富勒的微笑让那男孩不安，他很快转回视线，径直朝目的地走去。

Fuller was drunk enough that he might have nodded, tried his luck. But he’d realized, even before the young man averted his gaze, that all he himself wanted right now was to look at the small receding silhouette and imagine that it belonged to someone else, another boy, whose memory was proving persistent tonight, like that last Porter tune, which even here, in the darkness, he couldn’t quite dislodge from his head.
富勒有些醉意，本可以点头示意，试试运气。但在那年轻人移开视线前，他已明白，此刻自己只想凝视那渐行渐远的瘦小身影，想象那是另一个人，另一个男孩。今晚，那男孩的记忆格外顽固，就像最后一首波特曲调，即便在这黑暗中，也无法从他脑海中完全驱散。

He wondered what time it was in Scottsdale, and whether the embassy’s new phones were as good as Ms. Boyle said.
他想知道斯科茨代尔现在几点了，也好奇大使馆的新电话是否真如博伊尔女士说的那么好用。
